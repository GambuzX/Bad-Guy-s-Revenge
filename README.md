# Bad Guy's Revenge :dragon: :basketball: :video_game:

### Context
Game developed while following the "Complete C# Unity Developer" online course. I took the lectures as a basis to create something to my own liking and this was the result.

### Description
Laser Defender kind of game, where you are Goku and have to shoot multiple enemies that come appearing in waves.
The objective is to reach for the highest score.

Took inspiration in Dragon Ball :dragon::basketball: and also added many other of my own twists.
